The task
--------

Prior to starting this WOD, you might want to familiarize yourself with File IO in Java 7.

Start your timer.

Download this page onto your local computer, and name it webpage.html. In Eclipse, create a project called FileIO-CountLines. Enable Checkstyle for this project. Now write a program that reads in webpage.html, determines how many lines are in that file, and writes that integer to System.out.

When finished, stop your timer, and record how many minutes it took you to write this program. Your program should satisfy our coding standards. I recommend you take at least a short break between WODs.
