## Two Websites

This semester, we are running two website for ICS 211:  

1. the "traditional website" (a table layout that I have been using for years) 
2. this "new website" (a new layout that I am trying out for the first time)

Both websites <b>should</b> have the same material, but 
use the "traditional website" if there is anything missing or different on the "new website."
