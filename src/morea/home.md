## Two Websites

This semester, we are running two website for ICS 211:  

1. Table format website: a table layout that I have been using for years 
2. Morea format website: a new layout that I am trying out for the first time

Both websites <b>should</b> have the same material, but 
if there is anything missing or different on the Morea format website,
use the table format website.
