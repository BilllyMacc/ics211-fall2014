FALL 2014 - CRN: 50593 (3 credits)

## Contact Information:

Instructor:	William McDaniel Albritton<br>
Office Hours:	MW 1:15-3:15pm<br>
Office Location:	DA 211<br>
Contact:	(808) 455-0319 (walbritt AT Hawai'i DOT EDU)<br>

## Catalog Course Description:

Reinforce and strengthen problem-solving skills using more advanced features of programming languages and algorithms such as abstract data types, recursion, pointers, and memory management. Emphasize the use of data structures such as arrays, lists, stacks, queues and trees.

## Co-requisites:

None

## Prerequisites: 
ICS 111 and ICS 141 or equivalent, all with a grade of "C" or better, or instructor consent. This is a second course in computer programming which builds upon the skills developed in ICS 111 and the concepts learned in ICS 141.

## Recommended Preparations:

None

## Textbooks and other Resources:

Data Structures: Abstraction and Design Using Java by Elliot B. Koffman, Publisher: Wiley, ISBN-10: 0470128704 (optional)

## Student Learning Outcomes:

  1. Produce robust programs using exception handling and extensive program testing. 
  2. Develop recursive algorithms and programs. 
  3. Use standard libraries or packages as well as advanced object-oriented programming techniques such as polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulation.
  4. Select the appropriate searching or sorting algorithm based on the algorithm's behavior or complexity.
  5. Implement abstract data types such as lists, stacks and queues by using data structures such as arrays and linked lists.

## Grading Policy:

Assignments: 10 points each, 25 total 

Discussion and Private Messages Postings: 1 point each, 30 points total 

Final Project: 50 points each , 1 total 

Optional Assignments: 5 points each, roughly 3 total

Grade calculation: (sum of your scores) / (total points)

## Course grades: 
The percent grading scale is A = 100.00% - 90.00%, B = 89.99% - 80.00%, C = 79.99% - 70.00%, D = 69.99% - 60.00%, F = 59.99% and below. The course grades will not be scaled. There is no extra credit. Your current grade (including your course grade) is calculated in the Laulima Gradebook.

## Late assignments:

Two (2) points are deducted for late assignments. Two (2) points are deducted for assignments turned in on time, and re-submitted for re-grading after the due date. No late assignments will be accepted after the last day of classes.

## Student with Disabilities Statement:

Leeward Community College abides by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which stipulate that no student shall be denied the benefits of an education "solely by reason of a handicap." Students with documented disabilities who believe that they may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact the Coordinator of the KAKO'O 'IKE (KI) program as soon as possible to ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion. The KI office is on second floor mauka side of Learning Commons. Call for information at 455-0421.

## Assessment for Student Work:

With the goal of continuing to improve the quality of educational services offered to students, Leeward CC conducts assessments of student achievement of course, program, and institutional learning outcomes. Student work is used anonymously as the basis of these assessments, and the work you do in this course may be used in these assessment efforts.

## Discipline, Decorum, and Freedom of Speech:

Discrimination in the classroom based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, age, sex, physical-related challenges, learning-related challenges, sexual orientation, hate speech, and obscene language will not be tolerated. Refer to the University of Hawai'i's Policy of Nondiscrimination and Affirmative Action in Leeward Community College's catalog for more information.

## Academic Honesty:

Students are required to complete and submit their own work. Sharing files, duplicating disks, using another student's disk, copying, plagiarism, or other such acts will not be tolerated and are subject to penalties including a grade of "F" for the course. Refer to Academic Dishonesty in the Student Conduct Code for additional information.

## The Maka'ala Program:

At Leeward CC we want every student to be successful. The Maka'ala Program is a campus-wide effort that seeks to support students early in the semester when they first begin experiencing difficulty in a class. If I feel that you are having difficulty in my class within the first few weeks of the semester (e.g. missing class, missing assignments, or low test scores) I may refer you to the program. I will notify you about my intention to refer you to the program. Once referred, the Maka'ala Program will:

Send an email to your hawaii.edu account to let you know about my referral; and
Have a counselor follow up with you by phone or by email to find out what kinds of help you might need, to connect you with the necessary resources, and to help you devise a strategy for success.
Communication:

All communication will be through Laulima (https://laulima.hawaii.edu) and your UH email (https://mail.hawaii.edu). Email from other accounts will not be accepted.

## Required software:

Your program must compile and run using the jGRASP IDE.

## Assignment submission instructions:

1. Top of your assignment file: 
<pre>
   /**
    * Short description of program.
    *
    * @author Last Name, First Name
    * @assignment ICS 211 Assignment X 
    * @date Today's Date
    */ 
</pre>
2. Filename of your assignment: LastnameFirstnameX.java. (Note: For example, SuzukiBubba1.java would be submitted for the first assignment if Bubba Suzuki were submitting it.)<br>
3. "To" field of e-mail: The instructor's e-mail address: W Albritt at Hawai'i DOT edu<br>
4. "Cc" field of e-mail: Your UH UNIX e-mail address (That way, if the instructor does not get your email for some reason, you have proof that it was sent.)<br>
5. Subject of email: ics 211 #x (where 'x' is the assignment number) For example, the first assignment would be: ics 211 #1<br>
6. Body of email: Copy and paste the latest version of your program. That way, we have your program even if you forgot to attach it.<br>
7. Attachments: Attach your LastnameFirstnameX.java file. (DO NOT submit the LastnameFirstnameX.class file or a zip file.)<br>
8. After you send your e-mail: Be sure to double-check your assignment submission by opening the e-mail that you sent to the instructor, downloading the attached program, and compiling and running the program to make sure it works, and that it is the program that you intended to submit. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SENDING THE CORRECT PROGRAM. No excuses will be accepted.<br>

## Multiple submissions: 
You may submit an assignment more than one time. Only the most recent assignment submitted before the deadline will be graded. If you cannot make the deadline, then turn in what you have before the deadline for partial credit. After the deadline, at least two (2) points will be subtracted from your assignment grade.

## Assignment grading guidelines (assigments are graded out of 10 points):

1. (-1 point) Miscellaneous mistakes/problems.
2. (-1 point) Assignment not submitted according to specifications. For example, your name is missing, incorrect email subject, hardcopy not turned in, etc.
3. (-1 point) Bad interface. For example, output is not displayed for long enough for the user to read it, user has to guess what the input is, etc.
4. (-1 point) The program doesn't work as expected for some values.
5. (-2 points) Program crashes with bad user input. We will test boundary conditions and bad conditions when testing your programs. For instance, if your program asks for a number between 1-10, we will try inputting things like: -3, abc, 11, and 99999 to see if your program handles it, and asks for input again.
6. (-2 points) Assignment is late.
7. (-2 points) Assignment is submitted on time, and re-submitted for re-grading after the due date.
8. (-3 points) The program doesn't compile or crashes (has runtime errors), because of a small syntax error.
9. (-3 points) The program doesn't work as expected for any values.
10. (-3 points) Code not commented. Comments should be IN YOUR OWN WORDS. You should comment at every 3-5 lines of code.
11. (-3 points) Not following the ICS Java Coding Standard.
12. (-5 points) The program doesn't compile or crashes (has runtime errors), because of numerous syntax errors.
13. (-5 points) Copying the instructor's code or comments. All your code and comments should be in your own words.
14. (-10 points) Assignment is submitted after last day of classes.
15. (-10 points) Copying another student's code or comments. All your code and comments should be in your own words.
